--Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

--Other platforms similar to GitHub:-
i)GitLab
ii)SourceForge
iii)Google Cloud Source Repositories
iv)GitKraken

vi)BitBucket
vii)Launchpad
viii)AWS CodeCommit
ix)Phabricator
x)Gogs(Self-Hosted)


Q5. Why are you interested in learning of Git and Github?
